# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.


## js-0.14.1 - 2026-05-29

#### Bug Fixes

- Handle missing APIFY_HTTPBIN_TOKEN in musllinux aarch64 Python tests (#444)
  - Third-party PRs run without repository secrets, and the `musllinux` `aarch64` Python job was passing `APIFY_HTTPBIN_TOKEN` to `run-on-arch-action` in a way that produced a non-flat env value. That caused the job to fail before tests could use their existing fallback behavior.  ---------


- Migrate `http3` DNS lookup from `hickory-client` to `hickory-resolver` (#454)
  - `impit/src/http3.rs` only used hickory to fire a single HTTPS-record DNS query against a hard-coded `8.8.8.8:53` for h3 discovery. Migrated that to `hickory-resolver 0.26.1`, which: - pulls in the patched `hickory-proto 0.26.1`, - uses the system DNS config instead of hard-coding Google's resolver, - drops the manual background-task plumbing and `Drop` impl since the resolver manages its own connections.  API shifts handled along the way: `Record::data()` → `Record.data` (now a public field), `SVCB::svc_params()` → `SVCB.svc_params` (public field).


- Drop only-allow preinstall from the published package (#464)


## js-0.14.0 - 2026-05-07

#### Features

- Return the `vanillaFallback` option as an alternative for failing requests (#441)
  - The `vanillaFallback` option has been noop in a few of the latest versions of `impit`. The changes from this PR return this feature to support, e.g., servers with old TLS stacks that uncover some of the emulation discrepancies and cause the requests to fail.



## js-0.13.1 - 2026-04-22

#### Bug Fixes

- Decode non-ASCII response header values as ISO-8859-1 (#434)

- Use browser-matching multipart boundary format (#435)
  - Moves multipart boundary generation from JS to Rust where the browser fingerprint is available. Each browser profile now produces boundaries matching the real browser format:  - Chrome: `----WebKitFormBoundary` + 16 alphanumeric chars - Firefox: `----geckoformboundary` + two random uint64 hex values - OkHttp: UUID v4 (`xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`) - No fingerprint: `----formdata-impit-*` (default, unchanged)  The boundary is generated lazily — the NAPI call only happens when the body is actually a `FormData` instance. The method is not exposed in public types.



## js-0.13.0 - 2026-03-26

#### Features

- Add new OkHTTP fingerprints  (#416)
  - Adds profiles for emulating the fingerprints of the OkHTTP library (JVM / Android HTTP client).



## js-0.12.0 - 2026-03-24

#### Features

- Add per-request `redirect` option to `RequestInit` (#418)
  - ## Summary  Adds standard Fetch API [`redirect`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RequestInit/redirect) option to `RequestInit`, allowing per-request override of the instance-level `followRedirects` setting.  - `'follow'` — follow redirects (default, matches instance behavior) - `'manual'` — return the 3xx response as-is - `'error'` — throw `TypeError` on redirect  When set, overrides the instance-level `followRedirects` for that request. When omitted, instance-level `followRedirects` / `maxRedirects` are used as before.  Also extracts `Request.redirect` when a `Request` object is passed — but only for non-default values (`'manual'`, `'error'`), since `Request.redirect` defaults to `'follow'` per the Fetch API spec and would otherwise silently override instance-level `followRedirects: false`.  ## Changes  - **`index.wrapper.js`** — extract `redirect` in `parseFetchOptions`, thread through `fetch()` → `#fetchWithRedirectHandling()`, override instance-level `followRedirects` / throw on `'error'` - **`dts-header.d.ts`** — add `redirect` to `RequestInit` via interface merging - **`test/basics.test.ts`** — replace skipped httpbin-based redirect tests with 15 local server tests covering all modes, overrides, Request objects, status codes - **`test/mock.server.ts`** — add `/redirect/:n`, `/redirect-to`, `/get` routes - **`README.md`** — add per-request redirect usage example  ---------


- Add `clone()` support to `ImpitResponse` (#419)
  - ## Summary  Implements `Response.clone()` on `ImpitResponse` using `ReadableStream.tee()`, making impit compatible with libraries like [ky](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ky) that call `response.clone()` internally.  ## Approach  When `.clone()` is called:  1. `this.body.tee()` splits the underlying `ReadableStream` into two independent streams (synchronous, no eager buffering) 2. The original response's `.body` getter and body methods (`text`, `json`, `arrayBuffer`, `bytes`) are re-patched to read from one stream 3. A standard `Response` is returned as the clone, backed by the other stream  Multiple clones are supported (matching the Fetch spec) — each call tees the current branch, so the original and all clones can be read independently.  Charset-aware `text()` decoding is preserved on the original via `decodeBuffer`. The clone uses standard `Response.text()` (UTF-8).  Throws `TypeError` on clone after body consumption, matching Fetch API semantics.  ## Changes  - **`index.wrapper.js`** — add `clone()` in `#wrapResponse`, re-patch `.body` getter and body methods with `configurable: true` so subsequent clones work - **`dts-header.d.ts`** — add `clone(): Response` to `ImpitResponse` via declaration merging - **`test/basics.test.ts`** — tests covering: return type, url/header preservation, independent body reads, text() on both, multiple clones, body streaming after clone, clone-after-consume error, arrayBuffer on both, read ordering, non-200 status  ---------



## js-0.11.0 - 2026-03-13

#### Features

- Support `timeout=None` to disable timeout (#402)
  - Updates the timeout handling in Python. The default behaviour stays the same, but passing timeout=None now disables the timeout (either client-wide or for the current request). This aligns impit with how httpx handles timeouts.  ---------


- Better errors for Node.JS bindings (#406)
  - Closes https://github.com/apify/impit/issues/397.


#### Refactor

- Replace scraper with lol_html for HTML charset prescanning (#398)
  - Replaces `scraper` dependency with a more lightweight HTML parser from `lol_html`. Adds regression tests to ensure the behaviour stays the same.  ---------



## js-0.10.1 - 2026-03-02

#### Bug Fixes

- Keep `content-length` header in compressed responses (#395)


## js-0.10.0 - 2026-03-02

#### Bug Fixes

- Clean up AbortSignal listeners after fetch() completes (#394)
  - Drops `AbortSignal` listeners in Node.JS bindings to prevent memory leaks on `AbortSignal` reuse.  ---------


#### Features

- Add HTTP/2 SETTINGS fingerprinting (#386)
  - Adds custom HTTP2 profiles to the emulated browser fingerprints.  ---------



## js-0.9.2 - 2026-02-10

#### Bug Fixes

- Allow removing impersonated headers by passing empty string (#382)
  - Users can now remove impersonated headers (like `Sec-Fetch-User`) from requests by passing an empty string as the header value. When an empty string is provided, the header is filtered out before the request is sent.  This enables users, e.g., to manually control which `Sec-Fetch-*` headers should be included in their requests, addressing use cases where the default impersonated headers don't match the actual request context.



## js-0.9.1 - 2026-02-02

#### Bug Fixes

- Handle redirects/cookies in the JS layer (#375)
  - Solves high-concurrency segmentation faults, processes cookies and handles redirects fully in JS instead of Rust.



## js-0.9.0 - 2026-01-29

#### Bug Fixes

- Prevent double free on `Buffer` by passing a `BufferSlice` (#369)
  - As a non-async function, `decode_buffer` doesn't require owning the `Buffer` and can do with only a `BufferSlice`. This takes the cleanup responsibility from `napi-rs` and should prevent the double free scenarios, as the `Buffer` is now Node runtime-managed.


- Use the `rustls` `Verifier` / `CryptoProvider` cache with custom fingerprints (#371)
  - Speeds up repeated client instantiation and lowers the memory footprint if the custom fingerprints are used.  Related to #370


- Call `adjust_external_memory` on `Impit` instantiation (#372)
  - Large wrapped objects should `adjust_external_memory` to guide the native GC scheduler ([docs](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v8.9.4/docs/api/n-api.html#n_api_napi_adjust_external_memory)).  The size of 500kB is eyeballed (experiments show values around ~120kB), so this should give us enough leeway for the future.


#### Features

- Use rustls-platform-verifier for system CA support (#357)
  - Replaces the static `webpki-roots` dependency with `rustls-platform-verifier` to enable `impit` to rely on the operating system's trust store.  ---------


- Custom fingerprint support (#366)
  - Extracts all fingerprinting logic (from e.g. the `rustls` patch) to `impit`. Prepares the codebase for new, non-hardcoded browser fingerprints.  Related to #99


- Add more Chrome and Firefox fingerprints (#367)
  - Adds more browser fingerprints and passes these to the Node.JS and Python bindings.



## js-0.8.2 - 2026-01-12

#### Bug Fixes

- Avoid excessive wait on a non-aborted `Response` (#355)
  - Replaces the thread polling the `AbortSignal` for a channel.



## js-0.8.1 - 2026-01-09

#### Bug Fixes

- Add signal to the RequestInit type (#351)
  - Fixes an omission from #349



## js-0.8.0 - 2026-01-09

#### Bug Fixes

- Don't leak memory on failed requests (#350)
  - Related to https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs/issues/3086


#### Features

- Add support for JS `AbortSignal` (#349)


## js-0.7.6 - 2026-01-05

#### Bug Fixes

- Do not panic on missing attributes for encoding-related `meta` elements (#346)
  - Ignores encoding-related `meta` elements with missing `content` or `charset` attributes.  Related to #344


- Throw `Error` on invalid header value (do not panic) (#347)
  - Unparseable response header values now only return `Error` in the Node bindings instead of panicking and killing the process.  Related to #344



## js-0.7.5 - 2025-12-17

#### Bug Fixes

- Do not drop request-scoped options (`timeout` and `forceHttp3`) (#340)


## js-0.7.4 - 2025-12-09

#### Bug Fixes

- Authenticate with HTTPS proxy and HTTP target (#333)
  - Propagates upstream fixes from `reqwest`.



## js-0.7.3 - 2025-12-03

#### Features

- Enable `TRACE` method in the bindings (#328)
  - Unifies all clients by enabling the `trace` method in all of them. Required for type parity (`HttpMethod`) in downstream repositories - Crawlee et al.



## js-0.7.2 - 2025-12-02

#### Bug Fixes

- Raise Python exception on response body read error (#313)
  - Originally, Python Impit bindings would return a response with an empty body on a body read error. This didn't make much sense and caused issues in the downstream dependencies. Now we rethrow the error so it can be properly handled.  Closes https://github.com/apify/apify-sdk-python/issues/672


- Treat unexpected EOF error as `RemoteProtocolError` (#314)
  - Related to https://github.com/apify/apify-sdk-python/issues/672


- Proxy authenticates with empty password (#327)


## js-0.7.1 - 2025-11-11

#### Bug Fixes

- Align anonymous client API with httpx (#310)


## js-0.7.0 - 2025-11-07

#### Features

- Align `Impit.fetch` with `fetch` interface (#309)
  - Enables passing `Request` and `URL` instances to `Impit.fetch`.   Related to #227


#### Refactor

- Introduce `ImpitRequest` struct for storing all request-related data (#307)
  - Refactors the `impit.make_request` method by splitting it into `build_request` and `send`.  Prerequisite for the solution to #227 proposed in https://github.com/apify/impit/issues/227#issuecomment-3184109259



## js-0.6.1 - 2025-10-22

#### Bug Fixes

- Downgrade `napi-rs` tooling to fix random Windows hang ups (#296)


## js-0.6.0 - 2025-10-16

#### Bug Fixes

- Fallback to HTTP/2 on HTTP3 DNS error (#255)
  - Makes DNS client in HTTP/3 record resolution optional. If the initial connection fails with `Error`, impit will return `false` for every call to `host_supports_h3` (unless, e.g. `alt-svc` header has been registered for this domain).


- Do not panic on constructor param errors (#285)
  - Introduces better error handling for constructor parameter errors.


#### Features

- Improve error typing for certain HTTP errors (#250)
  - Improves error typing (mostly for Python version) on HTTP (network / server) errors and aligns the behaviour with HTTPX.


- Add `local_address` option to `Impit` constructor (#225)
  - Adds a `local_address` option to the Impit HTTP client constructor across all language bindings (Rust, Python, and Node.js), allowing users to bind the client to a specific network interface. This feature is useful for testing purposes or when working with multiple network interfaces.


- Include error message in `ConnectError` (#258)
  - Injects `cause` to the `ConnectError` display string. This allows for better error introspection in dependent packages.  Unblocks https://github.com/apify/crawlee-python/pull/1389/



## js-0.5.4 - 2025-08-13

#### Bug Fixes

- Allow passing request body in all HTTP methods except `TRACE` (#238)


## js-0.5.3 - 2025-07-24

#### Bug Fixes

- Log correct timeout duration on `TimeoutException` (#222)
  - Logs the default `Impit`-instance-wide timeout if the request-specific timeout is missing.


#### Refactor

- Improve thread safety, make `Impit` `Sync` (#212)


## js-0.5.2 - 2025-06-25

#### Features

- Client-scoped `headers` option (#200)
  - Adds `headers` setting to `Impit` constructor to set headers to be included in every request made by the built [`Impit`] instance.  This can be used to add e.g. custom user-agent or authorization headers that should be included in every request. These headers override the "impersonation" headers set by the `with_browser` method. In turn, these are overridden by request-specific `headers` setting.



## js-0.5.1 - 2025-06-11

#### Bug Fixes

- Solve memory leak on response read (#191)
  - Memory leak in `napi-rs`'s implementation of `ReadableStream` was causing `impit` to leak small amounts of memory on response read (`.text()`, `.json()`, `.bytes()` etc.).


#### Features

- Support `socks` proxy (#197)
  - Enables support for `socks` proxies to `impit-node`. This theoretically enables `socks` proxies for CLI and the Python binding as well, but this behaviour is untested due to a lack of working socks proxy server implementations in Python.



## js-0.5.0 - 2025-05-29

#### Bug Fixes

- Support `null` request payload, don't modify options (#190)
  - Removes parameter reassignment code smell. Fixes errors on `null` (or other nullish, but not expected) body.


#### Features

- Support for custom cookie stores for Node.JS (#181)
  - Adds `cookieJar` constructor parameter for `Impit` class, accepting `tough-cookie`'s `CookieJar` (or a custom implementation thereof, implementing at least `setCookie(cookie: string, url: string)` and `getCookieString(url: string)`).  `impit` will write to and read from this custom cookie store.  Related to #123



## js-0.4.7 - 2025-05-20

#### Features

- Add `resp.arrayBuffer`, improve Node <22 compatibility (#188)
  - Adds new `response.arrayBuffer` method ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/arrayBuffer)) and implements `response.bytes` using `arrayBuffer()` to improve compatibility with Node < 22 (`.bytes()` support was rather experimental until this version).



## js-0.4.6 - 2025-05-16

#### Features

- Add support for custom cookie store implementations (#179)
  - Allows to pass custom cookie store implementations to the `ImpitBuilder` struct (using the new `with_cookie_store` builder method). Without passing the store implementation, `impit` client in both bindings is by default stateless (doesn't store cookies).  Enables implementing custom support for language-specific cookie stores (in JS and Python).


- Show the underlying `reqwest` error on unrecognized error type (#183)
  - Improve error logs in bindings by tunneling the lower-level `reqwest` errors through to binding users.



## js-0.4.5 - 2025-05-07

#### Bug Fixes

- Render helpful error message on import errors (#171)
  - Wraps the original `napi-rs` `ENOENT` error with a more descriptive error message. Understands `IMPIT_VERBOSE` envvar for printing the original error message.



## js-0.4.2 - 2025-04-30

#### Features

- Better errors (#150)
  - Improves the error handling in `impit` and both the language bindings. Improves error messages.  For Python bindings, this PR adds the same exception types as in `httpx`.


- Switch to `Vec<(String, String)>` for request headers (#156)
  - Allows sending multiple request headers of the same name across all bindings / tools.  Broadens the `RequestInit.headers` type in the `impit-node` bindings. Closes #151


- Accept more `request.body` types (match `fetch` API) (#157)


## js-0.4.0 - 2025-04-23

#### Bug Fixes

- Set `response.text()` return type to `string` (#136)
  - The type definitions for `response.text()` return type used `String` (see capital S) instead of `string` (like `fetch` API does). Note that this is a strictly type-level issue and simple cast (or type change, in this case) solves this.


- Do not publish ambient `const enum`s (#144)
  - Switches from exporting `const enum`s from the `.d.ts` file ([which is problematic](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html#const-enum-pitfalls)) to exporting union types.  Makes the `browser` option accept lowercase browser names.


#### Features

- `response.headers` is a `Headers` object (#137)
  - Turns the `response.headers` from a `Record<string, string>` into a `Headers` object, matching the original `fetch` API.



## js-0.3.2 - 2025-04-15

#### Bug Fixes

- `response.encoding` contains the actual encoding (#119)
  - Parses the `content-type` header for the `charset` parameter.


- Case-insensitive request header deduplication (#127)
  - Refactors and simplifies the custom header logic. Custom headers now override "impersonated" browser headers regardless on the (upper|lower)case.


#### Features

- Add `url` and `content` property for `Response`, smart `.text` decoding, options for redirects  (#122)
  - Adds `url`, `encoding` and `content` properties for `Response`. Decodes the response using the automatic encoding-determining algorithm. Adds redirect-related options.  ---------



## js-0.3.1 - 2025-03-28

#### Bug Fixes

- Bundle native binary in `linux-arm64` packages (#100)
  - Followup to #94 , the `impit-linux-arm64-(gnu|musl)` published packages didn't have the native binary included due to naming mismatch.



## js-0.3.0 - 2025-03-28

#### Features

- Use `thiserror` for better error handling DX (#90)
  - Adds `std::error::Error` implementation with `thiserror`. This should improve the developer experience and error messages across the monorepo.



## js-0.2.5 - 2025-02-25

#### Bug Fixes

- Enable ESM named imports from `impit` packages (#78)
  - Lists the "named" exports from the `impit` package verbatim so they can be imported with  ```typescript import { Impit } from 'impit';  ```  from ESM packages without causing the following error:  ``` import { Impit } from "impit";          ^^^^^ SyntaxError: Named export 'Impit' not found. The requested module 'impit' is a CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports. CommonJS modules can always be imported via the default export, for example using:  import pkg from 'impit'; const { Impit } = pkg; ```



## js-0.2.4 - 2025-02-25

#### Bug Fixes

- Allow `impit` usage from ESM (#74)
  - Renames native code import to mitigate naming collision with global `exports`.



## js-0.2.3 - 2025-02-21

#### Bug Fixes

- Reenable HTTP/3 features in JS bindings (#57)
  - Recent package updates might have broken the `http3` feature in Node.JS bindings. This PR solves the underlying problems by building the reqwest's `Client` from within the `napi-rs`-managed `tokio` runtime.  Adds tests for `http3` usage from Node bindings.  Removes problematic Firefox header (`Connection` is not allowed in HTTP2 and HTTP3 requests or responses and together with `forceHttp3` was causing panics inside the Rust code).


- Decode response charset with headers and BOM sniffing (#68)
  - Calling  ```typescript const res = await impit.fetch('https://resource-with-non-utf8-response'); const text = await res.text(); ```  results in mangling the response text (as Impit expected only `utf-8`).  This PR fixes this by patching the `Impit.fetch()` return value. While it would be possible to implement this fully in Rust, this implementation is much simpler and opens the door for other patches like this.


#### Security

- Regenerate Node.JS lockfile with latest dependencies (#53)
  - Closes Dependabot security warnings.



## js-0.2.1 - 2025-02-11

#### Features

- Add `.url` field to `impit-node` Response (#43)
  - Adds [Response.url](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/url) property to the `ImpitResponse` struct / object.



## js-0.2.0 - 2025-02-07

#### Features

- Add `ReadableStream` in `Response.body` (#28)
  - Accessing `Response.body` now returns an instance of JS `ReadableStream`. This API design matches the (browser) Fetch API spec. In order to correctly manage the `Response` consumption, the current codebase has been slightly refactored.  Note that the implementation relies on a prerelease version of the `napi-rs` tooling.


#### Security

- Bump `vitest` version (#31)
  - Solves Dependabot security warnings.



## 0.1.5 - 2025-01-23

#### Bug Fixes

- Use replacement character on invalid decode (#25)
  - When decoding incorrectly encoded content, the binding now panics and takes down the entire JS script. This change replaces the incorrect sequence with the U+FFFD replacement character (�) in the content. This is most often the desired behaviour.



## js-0.1.1 - 2025-01-15
